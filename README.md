# PlayDate Tutorial Project

This is a backup of my first PlayDate tutorial project. I built it by following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0ufxinp7No), which is adapted from the [PlayDate SDK docs](https://sdk.play.date/1.9.0/Inside%20Playdate.html#developing-in-lua).

It's a simple game where a cat collects money for some unknown, but likely untoward, purpose. Collect as many coins as you can before the time runs out. Press "A" to restart the game once it ends.
